        <h3>Contribution</h3>
        <p>
          Built a PWA Flurrish website with TypeScript, React, Gatsby,
          Contentful and Amplify. Gatsby was leveraged to easily integrate with
          Contentful for sourcing data on build time and rebuilding using
          Amplify on Contentful webhooks. Contentful enabled easier content
          management from the marketing team saving hours of iteration for any
          content changes. Having a branded website that showcases the services
          and products Flurrish offers helped sell Flurrish into respectable
          schools around Canada.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worked on building a React Native app for facilitating student
          engagement by utilizing Expo, React Native and AWS Amplify. Amplify
          aided in quickly prototyping a GraphQL backend with DynamoDB as a
          persistant data store.
